# CADauto
Creating a custom AutoHotKey layout for CAD users who use the mouse on the right hand.

Holding the Space key while pressing keys on the left hand side will initiate keys mapped normally on the right hand side.

Users will have to install AutoHotKey application in order to use the keys.

V1.0:
- Developed a key set layout for presses with "Space + key"
- Included a variable toggle for Space so that holding it does not activate the press. Only on release

V1.1:
- Create an on and off press "Space + Enter" to toggle on the attributes.

V1.2
- Create the Space + Tab hot key to feature Enter button. Fully encapsulating the right handed keyboard controls to as much as possible.
