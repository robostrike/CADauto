# CADauto
Creating a custom AutoHotKey layout for CAD users who use the mouse on the right hand.

Holding the Space key while pressing keys on the left hand side will initiate keys mapped normally on the right hand side.

Users will have to install AutoHotKey application in order to use the keys.

V1.0:
- Developed a key set layout for presses with "Space + key"
- Included a variable toggle for Space so that holding it does not activate the press. Only on release

V1.1:
- Create an on and off press "Space + Enter" to toggle on the attributes. 

Bugs:
- Space bar activation only on Space Up, but on toggle off, the space bar usage still is on space up. So need to figure out how to fix that.
